We wanted to  examine the prevalence of gluten-free friendly restaurants in relation to the income of a given area. 
Our hypothesis was that there would be more gluten-free friendly restaurants in higher income areas 
(using zip codes to measure area).  We used API data from Yelp and the US Census Bureau to help us answer 
the following questions.  
  
Is eating gluten-free more expensive?​

Is there a relationship between overall income for Southern California vs. the amount of access?​

Is there a relationship between being rich and the amount of access to gluten-free options?
